# Summary
This is a group project for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning subject held by Dr. Anna Radzikowska at Politechnika Warszawska.
One of the requirements to pass the subject was to succesfully complete the project. We got this topic and divided our tasks. I was fully responsible for the implementation of the project. This application is web-based with HTML, CSS and Javascript technology. The application is dynamic, where user can add any possible scenarios to the system with predefined format. I also added autocomplete feature to cut the time consumption writing the scenarios and queries.
